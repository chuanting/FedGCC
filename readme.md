The repository contains the source code for our
paper [Gradient Compression and Correlation Driven Federated Learning for Wireless Traffic Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10818793)
published by IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and
Networking.

## Key Features
We are trying t build a communication-efficient and 
high-accurate decentralized 
wireless traffic prediction algorithm for future intelligent 
communication systems.

1. To reduce data communications between local clients the central 
   server, we introduce gradient compression into wireless traffic 
   prediction;
2. To keep prediction accuracy, we propose gradient correction and 
   tracking into local client model training;
3. To model spatial dependency, we design a family of heuristic 
   gradient re-grouping strategy based on gradient correlation, 
   which can reflect the correlation of BS's wireless traffic.
